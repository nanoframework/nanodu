```

  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
  with:
    stablePackages: true
    solutionsToCheck: 'amqp-nanoFramework.sln'
```

Update dependencies on several repositories using stable NuGet packages.

```yaml
- uses: nanoframework/nanodu@v1
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
  with:
    stablePackages: true
    reposToUpdate: >
      System.Net.Http
      System.Net.WebSockets
      System.Device.WiFi
      nanoFramework.m2mqtt
      nanoFramework.Azure.Devices
```

Update dependencies on all solutions, except `MyLibrary` and `MyOtherLibrary`, using preview NuGet packages.

```yaml
- uses: nanoframework/nanodu@v1
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
  with:
    previewPackages: true
    solutionsToCheck: 'amqp-nanoFramework.sln'
    exclusionList: 'MyLibrary,MyOtherLibrary'
```

>Note: in order to run properly this action requires setting up the GitHub token. There are numerous ways of doing this.
On the examples above it's being set on the action itself. If that's done elsewhere before the action runs, there is no need to do it again.
